# Projeto-ConvertTubeX

---

A Simple YouTube converter made with [Pytube][pytube] and [MoviePy][moviepy].

The [Pytube][pytube] is a genuine, lightweight, dependency-free Python library (and command-line utility) for downloading YouTube videos.

---

## Installation

This project requires an installation of Python 3.6 or greater, as well as pip. (Pip is typically bundled with Python installations.)



### Install dependencies

#### MoviePy:

* **Python 3.6+ or newer is required.**


```sh-session
pip install moviepy
```

---

#### Pytube:

* **Python 3.6+ or newer is required.**

* **Google is currently hard at work on the code that pytube uses for its API, so sometimes Google updates break the API/CODE, even if the developers try to find solutions for it, it's something that can take days to resolve, but can be faster because it is "open source"**

So for Pytube I recommend downloading the version that is in this git branch 'project/pytube', because it's faster than approving the official branch, and sometimes we're out of time, but it can be more dangerous as they're experimental features, so it's up to you risk using the same

#### Auto-PY-to-EXE:

* **Python 3.6+ or newer is required.**

Which is a .py to .exe converter using a simple graphical interface and PyInstaller in Python.

```sh-session
pip install auto-py-to-exe
```
